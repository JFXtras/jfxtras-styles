### Documentation 
Documentation of JMetro can be found in this link: [JMetro Java, Javafx theme documentation](https://pixelduke.com/java-javafx-theme-jmetro).  

### Getting JMetro
You can get the jar from Maven Central or download it from the [releases tab](https://github.com/JFXtras/jfxtras-styles/releases)

```groovy
implementation 'org.jfxtras:jmetro:11.6.15'
```

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jfxtras</groupId>
    <artifactId>jmetro</artifactId>
    <version>11.6.15</version>
</dependency>
```

### Source code
We have two important branches:

* **master** -> JavaFX 11 and above / Java 11 and above (actively developed branch)
* **jdk-8** -> JavaFX 8 / Java 8 (maintenance mode, no active development is ongoing) 

The master branch is being tested using JavaFX 11.

The jmetro-samples subproject has samples that you can run and also check out how to use JMetro.

### Java 8 version
The "jdk-8" branch has the code for versions 8 of JMetro which are meant to run with Java 8. It is in maintenance mode, 
no active development is ongoing. If you want me to add features or make backports from the "master" branch please consider
sponsoring those changes.

### Pull Requests (PR)
We welcome contributions via PR.  
Before submitting a PR, please file an issue for prior discussion. This will avoid you wasting time with a PR that
might not be approved because, for instance, it might be outside the intended scope of the project.

### Feedback request
Please show pictures of your application that is using JMetro or share it through social media. This is very important for us
to know how users are effectively using it and make adjustments accordingly, to make JMetro better, and, only if you allow it, to showcase example uses.    
Seeing JMetro being used is also always a source of motivation to keep working on it.
